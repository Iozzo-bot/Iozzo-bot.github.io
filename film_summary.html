    <h1>Film Summary</h1>
  <div id="text">
<p> Bowling for Columbine, a documentary created by director Michael Moore, follows the use of guns and violence in the United States. Columbine refers to the <a href=”https://www.history.com/topics/1990s/columbine-high-school-shootings”>April 20 1999 Massacre</a> at Columbine high school. Two students, Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold, killed 13 people and wounded 24 more in the mass shooting. According to Moore, the name stems from the idea that the two students had supposedly gone bowling before committing the crime. How do we know that bowling is not responsible for the crime? In the documentary, Moore follows gun violence and gun use throughout the United States. He went to a bank that gave a free gun with account opening, the actions of <a href=”https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlton-hestons-cold-dead-hands-speech-fired-up-nra-2000-1209349”>the NRA and Charles Heston</a>, and the Michigan Militia. While focusing on gun use and violence, Moore explores the possible reasons why gun use and violence is high in the United States.

<p>He spoke to Marilyn Manson, a known metal musician who sings about death and violence, as people tend to blame his persona and music for the issues. However, Moore paints another view on violence as an American issue rather than an idol issue. He showcases American military history with other countries, American citizens rioting and committing violent acts with guns, and how the news focuses on violence. Moore compares this to Canada, which has less incidents of gun violence, but is not <a href=”https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/statistics-canada-blames-gang-violence-shootings-as-homicide-rate-hits-10-year-high-1.4186494”>immune to it ourselves</a></p>

<p> One of the most impactful parts of the movie was when MIchael Moore brought two of the survivors of this massacre to the K-Mart head office. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold bought the bullets used in the massacre in bulk from the Kmart with no license or information needed. Michael Moore and the survivors went to the office to discuss why they sell them and ask them to stop. In a surprising turn of events, K-Mart did decide to stop selling these bullets. The movie concludes with Michael Moore confronting Charles Heston at his house about why he holds rallies in towns with gun violence. This confrontation leads Charles to walk away from the conversation. This movie has substantially deepened my knowledge on gun issues in the United States and how gun violence is affected by social constructs.
