    <h1>Social Constructs</h1>
    <p> One social construct that stands out in this documentary is American culture, or what the movie showcases that to be. In Canada, there is a belief that Americans have guns, and for a <a href=”https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081”>good reason</a>. This movie, viewed by Canadians, highlights Canadians innocence and peace-keeping capabilities while highlighting Americans violence and fear. However, this is a stereotype that is not true. In university education, many women face violence or sexual assault based on campus norms and culture (Horsman & Cormack 2018). Indigenous people in Canada have faced various racist and bigoted actions towards them throughout <a href=”https://ipsmo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/timeline-game-handout-version.pdf”>the history of Canada</a> . Moore decides to not discuss this in his narrative as it does not focus on the innocence he is trying to portray. As Johnson (2005) puts it, if white heterosexual males ignore their privilege, it makes it harder for these under privileged groups to create the difference they need. With Moore having the large-scale attention he does with this documentary, he could describe that even though gun violence is lower in Canada, the country does have violence and issues itself.

</p>

<p> Another social construct that resonated with me throughout the movie was who gun violence affects. This was highlighted for me in the scene at Charles Heston’s house. As he walked away while Moore was talking to him, he walked through what seemed like a never-ending mansion. He had glass walls and open concept rooms on top of the already incredible size of his yard and driveway. Heston was a big proponent of the second amendment of the United States constitution, which is the right to bear arms. He starred in such movies like <a href=”https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_92”>Ben Hur</a> and <a href=”https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059418/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_83”>Major Dundee</a>:

<p> These movies highlighted violence and action. He is a white heterosexual man. He holds a Nationalist view and strong Christian beliefs. However, in his real life, he was away from any violence or action, as this was a privilege given to him by his wealth and fame. Schubiner, Scott, & Tzelepix (1993) found that gun violence is more common in lower socioeconomic status youth. These youth were more likely to be black as well. In my opinion, it is easy to stand for gun violence when it has never personally affected you. Over 40% of the youth in the study have seen someone shot or knifed, and over 20% have seen someone killed. Based on Charles Heston’s actions and lifestyle in the movie, he may never have used the guns for defense in his real life.


</p>
<p> A second notion of Charles Heston’s character is his Christian beliefs as mentioned before. A study by Whitehead, Schnabel, & Perry (2018) found that people with strong Christian views tend to be more pro-gun. They believe it is a God-given right and sacred. Although there is no mention of guns within the religion as far as my education goes, there seems to be a strong support of them. Charles Heston’s belief in guns follows his privileges, but Michael Moore’s belief in more gun laws follows his. Celebrities tend to be Liberal, as you may have noticed in the recent award shows or the level of Trump jokes in satire news today. <a href=”https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/conservative-vs-liberal-beliefs/”>This article</a> highlights the differences between liberal and conservative groups, specifically in gun control. Liberals believe in more government-regulated gun control. This helps to explain Moore’s motive behind this movie.

</p>
<p> An interesting concept to analyze is Hollywood, and more specifically, liberal Hollywood. Colby (2018) wrote an <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/opinion/sunday/hollywood-liberal.html”> opinion piece about why he believes Hollywood is liberal</a>. In this, he ponders a few ideas. One of them is the state. In the United States, most acting is done in either New York or California, traditionally liberal states. However, actors may come from anywhere. Another idea is that most actors have a bachelor’s degree, which puts them in the realm of a Liberal education. Finally, the idea I believe to be the most interesting is the emotion idea. It’s the idea that actors and filmmakers are trained to see or display a full range of emotions. In Michael Moore’s case, he would show this through his art form of film. Due to this, they have more empathy and care for others.

While these social constructs were displayed throughout the film, I decided to analyze the possible impact of these constructs on gun control.
