  <h1>Critical Analysis</h1>
<p> Sadly, gun control influences who I am as an educator. According to NBC San Diego, there have been more than <a href=”https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/School-Shootings-Since-Columbine-508503771.html”>230 school shootings in the United States since Columbine</a>. While I am an educator in Canada, this does not mean that school shootings do not occur <a href=”https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/deadly-shootings-schools-canada-1.3416685”>here</a>. I want to focus this section on what can be done about these from the scope of social constructs. I believe some were missed in Bowling for Columbine.

<h2> Bullying </h2>
<p> Bullying is a construct that affects the lives of many students. Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold were known as outcasts in the school.The movie touched on this briefly by interviewing South Park’s Matt Stone. He states how small town Colorado sucks. If you have ever seen South Park, you would see this yourself. Here’s a quick clip of some scenes to show how Matt Stone feels about small towns in Colorado:

<p> According to <a href”https://www.westword.com/news/the-missing-motive-5063685”>reports</a>. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were bullied throughout school. They seemed to have a hatred for the other students in the school for their actions and the exclusion of them from activities. From the Martino & Palllotta-Chiarolli (2007) article, we know that gendered-bullying in school can be harsh. A boy in the article states, “At a boys’ school, athletic ability and strength plays a large role in how many mates and how popular you are. So if you’re fat and a spastic you’re doomed to eternal rejection. (SSBS M 2/16)” (Martino & Pallotta-Chiarolli 2007 p.356). This concept can have a huge impact on students. In a study by Arseneault, Bowes, & Shakoor (2010), youth bullying victimization is associated with many negative life characteristics. These youth tend to have severe symptoms of mental health, violent behaviour, and psychotic symptoms. This leads me into my next topic -- mental health.

</p>
<h2> Mental Health </h2>
<p> As a disclaimer, I want to point out that mental health very rarely leads to violent behaviour. Even in the rare cases that it does, experts believe there are better ways to prevent gun violence in schools and as a whole, like <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html”>putting more laws and regulations into place</a>. However, I don’t want to ignore the cases of mental health in these adolescents. The FBI recognized that these youth struggled with <a href=”https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/04/at-last-we-know-why-the-columbine-killers-did-it.html”> mental health issues and possibly psychopathy</a>. How does our current school systems handle mental health issues? Not well. A review of mental health services in schools in the states are not based on empirical research (Rones & Hoagwood 2000). This study was done around the time of Columbine. It seems outrageous that schools used processes that had no basis. Recognizing mental health issues can be a huge part of having a safe and secure environment for our students.
